GOAL GETTERS


Problem Statement:
In the dynamic and highly competitive landscape of English Premier League (EPL) sports, understanding the factors that contribute to a player's performance is paramount for both sports analysts and team managers. One hypothesis that warrants investigation is the "Effect of Form on Stats," which raises the question: Is there a statistically significant correlation between a player's recent form and their performance statistics in subsequent EPL games, both at home and away venues?

Hypothesis 1Recent form has no impact on specific player statistics, such as goals scored, assists, pass completion rate, or defensive actions.

Hypothesis2 Alternative Hypothesis (H1): Recent form has a significant impact on specific player statistics in EPL games.
