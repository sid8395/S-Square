Business Case:

In the world of professional football (soccer), understanding player performance is crucial for team managers, coaches, and scouts. Passing accuracy and assist statistics are key performance indicators that can greatly impact team success. A deeper analysis of these metrics can provide valuable insights into player performance and help clubs make data-driven decisions in areas such as recruitment and tactical planning.


Problem Statement:
The problem at hand is to analyze the relationship between passing accuracy and the average assists made by football players. We want to investigate whether there is a correlation between a player's ability to make accurate passes and their effectiveness in creating goal-scoring opportunities for their teammates. Additionally, we aim to compare the passing accuracy and its impact on assist averages across the top 5 football leagues in the world.



 Hypothesis 1. How does passing accuracy correlate with the average assists made by players?
 hypothesis 2 How do the top 5 leagues differ in terms of passing accuracy and its impact on assist averages?

We will examine data from the top 5 football leagues and assess whether there are variations in passing accuracy and its impact on assist averages among these leagues. This will help identify league-specific trends and patterns.
 

 We tried to understand how these two factors will be crucial for a sports company driven toward making data-driven decisions
